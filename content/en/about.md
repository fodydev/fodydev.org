{{< intro >}}
FodyDev is an open-source organization. Our goal is to create free and open tools that support and promote African culture.
{{< /intro >}}

We believe that African languages and traditions are important. Technology should help protect and share this rich culture.

By building tools in the open, we can work together and learn from each other. We believe that when people share ideas and work openly, they can create more and do better.

FodyDev is here to connect people, build useful projects, and support the future of African languages through technology.
